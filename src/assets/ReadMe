In svg folder there are different svg files.
While styling like the original color of icon is black or any other we can
change that color directly in svg file or we can change height and width etc
directly in that svg file.
We have to use ReactComponent to access the svg file and for that we have to install
different plugins which will be a difficult thing to handle.
So we can create an assets.js file and simply import the files and create an object and
directly import assets file in different components and pages to access those icons.

src{assets.icons.arrow} we can use like this in img tag but we can also directly pass the
path like src='../src/assests/svg/arrow'
